# RetroBar-WindowsXP-UnlockedNoTopTheme
**This is just a modified theme for RetroBar all credit goes to the RetroBar team**

The theme lets you remove the top bar of the unlocked taskbar, which means that you can keep the the little spacers in the quick access section

# Install
Place everything inside the retrobar folder that contains the .exe file
For example: C:\Program Files\RetroBar (depends on wherever you have placed it)

It should look like this:

You might have noticed that two new folders are present in the image, these folders should be there after you place the files inside the folder

Alternatively you can place them into %localappdata%\RetroBar... if you wanted that for some reason (though you might still need to place the Resources folder inside the normal folder)

# Reminder
Restart RetroBar for the theme to show up in the drop down
